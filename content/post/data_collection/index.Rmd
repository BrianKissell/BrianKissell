## Create a New and Relevant Dataset

We live in am exciting moment. The data necessary to address the relevant and meaningful questions related to your business and personal goals is more available than ever before. However, it can still be difficult to collect and organize that data in a manner in which it can be utilized. As such, I would love to help you build a new dataset tailored specifically to address your questions. The following are some examples of data collection projects I would be happy to help you with.

### Utilize an API

Many organizations have created APIs to share particular data that they have collected with the public. However, collecting that data can be difficult for those without prior experience. As such, I provide a service in which I help you to gain access to API credentials, write a program to collect data relevant to your project, conduct some initial processing and cleaning, and then export the new data set into your preferred file format. In addition, I will provide thorough anotation within the program so that you can understand how the program works, and know how you can use this program again in the future. There are numerous valuable and useful APIs, but I will give you two examples to give an idea of what is possible.

**Twitter**
