<h2>Data Cleaning</h2>
<p>Most of us are surrounded by a staggering amount of underutilized data. The problem is that while data is available (which we often intentionally collected), it is currently stored in a form which makes it inaccessible. I would love to help you get that data into a format in which it can be used.</p>
