<p>Why do scientists study what they choose to study? Why would one dedicate their life towards gaining the complex technical skills that allow for scientific pursuit? I believe that most of us entered scientific disciplines because we believe that science can bring about incredible insight &amp; understanding that can be used to improve the lives of people. For the past eight to ten years, I have dedicated a significant portion of time attempting to develop the skills necessary to help real people understand complex scientific research. I have done this because I believe that scientific research should be utilized and for that to take place, real people need to be persuaded of its value.</p>
<p>During my undergraduate education, I created the methodology for psychology podcast in which I created more than 60 episodes. In these episodes, I interviewed experts in the field about their research and the methods they used. The purpose was to present academic research in a manner that could be understood by a general audience. I took down the podcast to allow me to focus on graduate school, but you can find the archived podcast information <a href="https://methodologyforpsychology.wordpress.com/">here</a>. My time within my graduate program also provided me with numerous opportunities to develop skills related to science communication. I was a teaching assistant for four semesters, and I was the course instructor for six semesters in which I taught multiple topics (i.e., research methods, social psychology, and stress). I was also able to write numerous research manuscripts, and to present my results in many poster sessions and talks.</p>
<p>There are numerous technologies and techniques that help to facilitate good science communication. Some of my favorite data visualization tools are <em>ggplot2</em>, <em>matplotlib</em>, <em>tableau</em>, and <em>power bi</em>. For manuscripts, as well as most written types of reports, I tend to use <em>R Markdown</em>. I use <em>R Studio</em> and <em>blogdown</em> to run my website (which I host on <em>github</em>). I also tend to construct dashboards with <em>rshiny</em> and <em>shinydashboards</em>.</p>
