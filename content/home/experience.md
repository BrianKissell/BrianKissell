In this position, I managed a research team in running experiments, surveys, and web scraping studies. These projects included hypothesis generation, study design, data collection, data analysis, statistical modeling, and reporting of results. In these projects, I utilized data visualizations, multiple regression and correlation analysis, analysis of variance, meta-analysis, Bayesian analysis, and supervised and unsupervised machine learning, and much more. One example of a project that I work on is that I constructed and validated a new measure with the use of numerous psychometric techniques, including parametric and non-parametric item response theory, factor analysis, classical test theory, and structural equation modeling. I also utilized natural language processing, textual analysis techniques, and classification models to evaluate textual data.
