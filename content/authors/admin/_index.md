I am an applied experimental psychologist, quantitative researcher, and data scientist. I am passionate about utilizing valid and robust methodological and statistical techniques to address meaningful and important questions relevant to business and individuals. I am particularly interested in factors related to how people think about, and respond to, the world around them, and I believe that businesses and data scientists can strongly benefit by focusing on how these factors influence the outcomes of which we are interested. We live in a moment where we have access to an amount of data that has never before been available, and I am thrilled to continue utilizing methods and techniques to gain valuable and meaningful insights that can help each of us to achieve our desired goals.
