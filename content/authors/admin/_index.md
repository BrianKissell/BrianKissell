I am an applied experimental social psychologist with an expertise in quantitative research, data analysis, and statistical modeling. In 2018, I began to learn about the incredible world of data science, and I found myself drawn to the area for many reasons. One of the main reasons was that I found data science to more closely represent my values as a researcher, and I will share an example. I was originally drawn to social psychology because I am passionate about utilizing methodologically, and statistically, robust techniques to address important questions that could substantially, or incrementally, improve the lives of people. While it is sometimes possible to do this well within academia, the incentives to rigorously pursue real insights that can improve business decision-making, and provide real benefits to organizational decision-makers, are much stronger in data-science.

While much of my prior work has focused on attitude formation, persuasion, decision-making, and social cognition, I have always been mostly interested in diving into new research areas, generating hypotheses, designing informative studies, and learning and utilizing new skills, techniques, and technologies. I have a large amount of experience within experimental and survey design, exploratory data analysis, multiple regression/correlation analysis, psychometrics, structural equation modeling, and meta-analysis. I am also very interested in web-scraping, natural language processing, and machine learning (both supervised and unsupervised).  R, SQL, Python, Tableau, SPSS, Shell, Spreadsheets, Excel, Git, and HTML/CSS.
